# Brandon's Study Notes

Gitbooks format study notes

## Preface

I usually brows a web page with Evernote Clearly, and take a quick note into Evernote. 
But sometimes, if I have to give a presentation, I will write my study notes in power point format.
Besides, I also write the technical document in Markdown or AsciiDoc format.

As a result, Some of my notes are in evernotes, some are in slides formate, and some are in Markdown/AsciiDoc format.
It really annoyed me when I need to find some notes.

So I decide to gather my notes into one place.
