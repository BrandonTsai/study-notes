https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/

Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets `[ nums[i], nums[j], nums[k] ]` such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0`.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
Output: [ [-1,-1,2] , [-1,0,1] ]

Explanation: 
nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0.
nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0.
nums[0] + nums[3] + nums[4] = (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0.
The distinct triplets are [-1,0,1] and [-1,-1,2].
Notice that the order of the output and the order of the triplets does not matter.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [0,1,1]
Output: []

Explanation: The only possible triplet does not sum up to 0.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: nums = [0,0,0]
Output: [[0,0,0]]

Explanation: The only possible triplet sums up to 0.
```

Constraints:

```
3 <= nums.length <= 3000
-105 <= nums[i] <= 105
```


Hint
=====

We usually use `Set` to avoid the duplicat items.
However, it is not possible to directly add the list itself to the set, since set elements must be hashable .
you have to convert a list to a tuple for keeping it in a set object.
But the convertion takes more time.
Unless you have very restricted memory environment, other it does not worth it.

The Python list sort() has been using the Timsort algorithm since version 2.3.
This algorithm has a runtime complexity of O(n.logn).


> **Hint**: Remove duplicate items via Set() is much faster than run `if x in a list`

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], t: int, result: List[List[int]]):
        target = -nums[t]
        i = t+1
        j = len(nums)-1
        while i < j:
            sum = nums[i] + nums[j]
            if sum == target:
                result.append([nums[t], nums[i], nums[j]])
                i += 1
                while i < j and nums[i] == nums[i-1]:
                    i += 1
            elif sum < target:
                i += 1
            else:
                j -= 1

    def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        nums.sort()
        result = []
        for t in range(len(nums)-2):
            if t > 0 and nums[t] == nums[t-1]:
                continue
            self.twoSum(nums, t, result)
        return result
```
