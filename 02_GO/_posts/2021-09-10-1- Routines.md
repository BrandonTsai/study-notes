Introduction to Goroutines and Concurrency:
----------------------------------------------------------------

In Go, concurrency is the ability of a program to execute multiple tasks concurrently. Goroutines are an essential feature of Go that enables concurrent programming. A goroutine is a lightweight, independently executing function that runs concurrently with other goroutines in the same address space. Goroutines make it easy to achieve concurrency in Go by allowing you to execute multiple tasks concurrently without creating excessive overhead.


To create a goroutine, you simply put the function call with the go keyword in front of it. For example:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func sayHello() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, world!")
}

func main() {
	go sayHello() // Create and start a goroutine

	// Main function continues to execute concurrently with the goroutine
	fmt.Println("Main function continues...")
	time.Sleep(1 * time.Second) // Wait for the goroutine to finish
}

```

You can also start a goroutine for an anonymous function call.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	// Starting a goroutine for an anonymous function call
	go func() {
		for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
			fmt.Println("Goroutine:", i)
			time.Sleep(500 * time.Millisecond)
		}
	}()

	// Continue with the main function
	for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
		fmt.Println("Main function:", i)
		time.Sleep(300 * time.Millisecond)
	}
}

```



### sync.WaitGroup

In Go, you can use the sync.WaitGroup to wait for multiple goroutines to finish before continuing with the main goroutine. The WaitGroup is part of the sync package and provides a simple way to synchronize and wait for a specified number of goroutines to complete their tasks.

Here's how you can use the sync.WaitGroup to wait for multiple goroutines to finish:


```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

func worker(id int, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
	defer wg.Done() // Signal that the goroutine is done when it exits

	fmt.Printf("Worker %d started\n", id)
	time.Sleep(1 * time.Second) // Simulate some work
	fmt.Printf("Worker %d done\n", id)
}

func main() {
	const numWorkers = 5

	var wg sync.WaitGroup

	// Start multiple worker goroutines
	for i := 1; i <= numWorkers; i++ {
		wg.Add(1) // Increment the WaitGroup counter before starting a goroutine
		go worker(i, &wg)
	}

	// Wait for all worker goroutines to finish
	wg.Wait()

	fmt.Println("All workers have completed their tasks")
}

```

Output (Example output, actual order may vary):

```bash
Worker 1 started
Worker 2 started
Worker 3 started
Worker 4 started
Worker 5 started
Worker 3 done
Worker 1 done
Worker 4 done
Worker 2 done
Worker 5 done
All workers have completed their tasks
```

In this example, we have a worker function that performs some work and takes a `*sync.WaitGroup` as an argument. Inside the worker function, we call `wg.Done()` using defer to signal that the goroutine is done when it exits.

In the main function, we create a `sync.WaitGroup` named wg and start multiple worker goroutines using a loop. Before starting each goroutine, we increment the WaitGroup counter using `wg.Add(1)` to indicate that a new goroutine is being added to the WaitGroup.

After starting all the goroutines, we call `wg.Wait()` to block the main goroutine until all the worker goroutines have called `wg.Done()` and signaled that they have completed their tasks.

Using the `sync.WaitGroup`, you can ensure that the main goroutine waits for all the worker goroutines to finish before proceeding with further tasks. This is a powerful technique for coordinating the execution of multiple concurrent goroutines and ensuring that they complete their work before the program continues.
