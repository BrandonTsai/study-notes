Go for software developing.
---------------------------

Go is becoming more famous and important in the world of software development
because following advantages:

**1. It is fast.**

The code is directly translated into formats that a processor understands instead of compiling into byte-code first
This not only improves the speed of getting things done, but also make it more maintainable.


**2. It supports concurrency.**

The Go language has Goroutines function that can run simultaneously and independently. This feature make it scalable when dealing with several concurrent processes.

**3. It is lightweight.**

Goroutines are lightweight threads which takes little memory space. It is possible to run millions of GoRoutines without crashing the system
This make it very suitable for microservice and cloud platform.


When Go comes to DevOps.
