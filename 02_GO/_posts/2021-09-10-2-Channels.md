title: "Synchronization with Channels"

When two or more goroutines need to share data with one another, you need to ensure proper synchronization to avoid data races and ensure data consistency. In Go, you can achieve synchronization using `channels` .


Channels are a communication mechanism that allows goroutines to send and receive data until the other side is ready. This allows goroutines to synchronize without explicit locks or condition variables. They ensure safe communication and synchronization between goroutines.



### Syntex

- Make a channel: `make(chan [value-type])`, where [value-type] is the data type of the values to send and receive, e.g., int.

- Share data using channel operator `<-`:
  - `channel <- data` : Send values to channel.
  - `variable := <- channel ` : Receive values from channel.
where <- is the channel operator.

- Close a channel: close(channel).
After closing, no value will be sent to the channel.

Here's an example of using channels for synchronization:


```go
package main
import "fmt"

// Prints a greeting message using values received in
// the channel
func greet(c chan string) {

	name := <- c	// receiving value from channel
	fmt.Println("Hello", name)
}

func main() {

	// Making a channel of value type string
	c := make(chan string)

	// Starting a concurrent goroutine
	go greet(c)

	// Sending values to the channel c
	c <- "World"

	// Closing channel
	close(c)
}
```


### Channel Buffering


Channel buffering is a feature in Go that allows you to specify the capacity of a channel. By default, channels in Go are unbuffered, meaning they can only hold one value at a time. When a value is sent on an unbuffered channel, the sender will block until the receiver is ready to receive the value.

In contrast, with channel buffering, you can specify the number of values a channel can hold before it starts blocking. This can be useful in scenarios where you want to decouple the sender and receiver, allowing the sender to continue sending values without blocking immediately, even if the receiver is not ready to receive them.

To create a buffered channel in Go, you use the make function with the second argument specifying the buffer size. 



### Channel Directions

In Go, channel directions refer to whether a channel is used for sending values (send-only channel), receiving values (receive-only channel), or both sending and receiving values (bidirectional channel). Channel directions are specified when creating channels and are enforced by the compiler to ensure safe concurrent communication.

Here are the three possible channel directions in Go:

1. Send-Only Channel (chan<- T):
   - A send-only channel is used to send values of type T.
   - It allows goroutines to send values into the channel but not receive from it.
   - This ensures that only designated goroutines can send data to the channel, providing better safety in concurrent scenarios.
1. Receive-Only Channel (<-chan T):
   - A receive-only channel is used to receive values of type T.
   - It allows goroutines to receive values from the channel but not send to it.
   - This ensures that only designated goroutines can receive data from the channel, enhancing data consistency and preventing data races.
2. Bidirectional Channel (chan T):
   - A bidirectional channel is used for both sending and receiving values of type T.
   - It allows goroutines to both send and receive values through the channel.
   - Bidirectional channels are the most common type of channels and are often used for communication between goroutines.



```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func worker(id int, jobs <-chan int, results chan<- int) {
	for job := range jobs {
		fmt.Printf("Worker %d started job %d\n", id, job)
		time.Sleep(1 * time.Second) // Simulate some work
		fmt.Printf("Worker %d finished job %d\n", id, job)
		results <- job * 2 // Send the result to the results channel
	}
}

func main() {
	const numJobs = 5

	// Create channels
	jobs := make(chan int, numJobs)
	results := make(chan int, numJobs)

	// Create 3 worker goroutines
	for w := 1; w <= 3; w++ {
		go worker(w, jobs, results)
	}

	// Send jobs to the jobs channel
	for j := 1; j <= numJobs; j++ {
		jobs <- j
	}

	close(jobs) // Close the jobs channel to signal no more jobs are coming

	// Collect results from the results channel
	for r := 1; r <= numJobs; r++ {
		result := <-results
		fmt.Println("Result:", result)
	}
}

```

output

```go
Worker 1 started job 1
Worker 2 started job 2
Worker 3 started job 3
Worker 1 finished job 1
Worker 1 started job 4
Worker 2 finished job 2
Worker 2 started job 5
Worker 3 finished job 3
Worker 1 finished job 4
Worker 2 finished job 5
Result: 2
Result: 4
Result: 6
Result: 8
Result: 10

```
