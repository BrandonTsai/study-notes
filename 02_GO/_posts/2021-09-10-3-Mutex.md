title: "Synchronization with Mutex"

We've seen how channels are great for communication among goroutines.
But what if we don't need "Send and Receive" communication? What if we just want to make sure only one goroutine can access a variable at a time to avoid conflicts?

That is where a `mutex (short for "mutual exclusion")` comes to protect the shared resources from concurrent access by multiple goroutines. It ensures that only one goroutine can access a critical section of code or a shared resource at a time, preventing data races and ensuring data integrity.

In Go, the sync package provides the Mutex type, which represents a mutual exclusion lock. A mutex has two main operations: Lock and Unlock. When a goroutine wants to access a shared resource, it first acquires the mutex by calling Lock. If the mutex is already locked by another goroutine, the calling goroutine will be blocked (put to sleep) until the mutex becomes available. Once the goroutine has finished using the shared resource, it releases the mutex by calling Unlock, allowing other goroutines to acquire it.

Here's a simple example of using a mutex to protect a shared resource:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

var sharedResource int
var mu sync.Mutex // Mutex to protect the shared resource

func accessSharedResource() {
	mu.Lock() // Acquire the mutex to access the shared resource
	defer mu.Unlock() // Release the mutex when the function exits

	// Simulate some work on the shared resource
	sharedResource++
	time.Sleep(500 * time.Millisecond)

	fmt.Println("Accessed shared resource:", sharedResource)
}

func main() {
	// Launch multiple goroutines to access the shared resource concurrently
	for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
		go accessSharedResource()
	}

	// Wait for all goroutines to finish
	time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
}

```

Output (Example output, actual order may vary):

```bash
Accessed shared resource: 1
Accessed shared resource: 2
Accessed shared resource: 3
Accessed shared resource: 4
Accessed shared resource: 5
```

In this example, we define the accessSharedResource function, which accesses and modifies the sharedResource variable. Before accessing the shared resource, the function acquires the mutex using mu.Lock(), which prevents other goroutines from accessing the shared resource simultaneously. After the work on the shared resource is complete, the function releases the mutex using defer mu.Unlock().

In the main function, we launch multiple goroutines concurrently to access the shared resource. Thanks to the mutex, only one goroutine can access the sharedResource at a time, ensuring data consistency and preventing race conditions.

Using mutexes is an essential technique for managing concurrent access to shared resources and ensuring data integrity in concurrent Go programs. It helps prevent data races and ensures that your concurrent code behaves predictably and correctly. However, it's important to use mutexes judiciously to avoid potential deadlocks and contention issues.

When should we use 'mutex' instead of 'channel'
----------------------------------------------------------------

Whether to use a mutex or a channel for synchronization in Go depends on the specific requirements and characteristics of your concurrent program. Both mechanisms serve different purposes and have their strengths and weaknesses.

Use a mutex when:

- **Shared Resource Protection Only**: When you just need to protect shared resources (e.g., variables, data structures) from concurrent access by multiple goroutines, a mutex is a suitable choice. It ensures that only one goroutine can access the shared resource at a time, preventing data races and ensuring data integrity.
- **Efficiency**: In scenarios with high contention, using a mutex can be more efficient than a channel. Mutexes are lightweight and have lower overhead, making them suitable for scenarios where synchronization overhead needs to be minimized.

Use a channel when:

- **Communication and Synchronization**: Channels are primarily designed for communication and synchronization between goroutines. They provide a powerful way to send and receive values and coordinate the execution of goroutines.
- **Multi-Producer, Multi-Consumer**: Channels are well-suited for scenarios involving multiple producers and multiple consumers. They allow you to decouple the producers and consumers and handle data asynchronously.
- **Coordination Across Goroutines**: Channels enable coordination across goroutines, allowing them to wait for each other to complete specific tasks or share data.

Ultimately, the choice between a mutex and a channel should be based on the specific requirements and design of your concurrent program. Understanding the trade-offs and characteristics of each synchronization mechanism will help you make an informed decision and create efficient and reliable concurrent Go programs.
