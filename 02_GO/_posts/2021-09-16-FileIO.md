os.Open() vs ioutil.ReadFile()


Specify the file path 
-----------------

To get the file path of $HOME/.ssh/id_pub in Go, you can use the os.UserHomeDir() function to get the path to the user's home directory, and then append the .ssh/id_pub file path to it. Here's an example:

```go

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"path/filepath"
)

func main() {
	homeDir, err := os.UserHomeDir()
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Error getting home directory: %s\n", err.Error())
		return
	}

	pubKeyPath := filepath.Join(homeDir, ".ssh", "id_pub")
	fmt.Printf("Public key path is: %s\n", pubKeyPath)
}
```

In this example, the os.UserHomeDir() function is used to get the path to the user's home directory, and then the filepath.Join() function is used to concatenate the .ssh/id_pub file path to it. Finally, the pubKeyPath variable is printed to the console.

Note that the filepath.Join() function is used instead of simply concatenating strings with the / separator, as this is platform-independent and handles different path separators on different operating systems.


Check file exist or not
--------------------------

In Go, you can use the os.Stat function to check if a file exists or not before reading it. Here's an example:

```yaml
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	filename := "example.txt"

	// Check if file exists
	if _, err := os.Stat(filename); os.IsNotExist(err) {
		// File does not exist
		fmt.Printf("File '%s' does not exist\n", filename)
		return
	}

	// Read the file
	data, err := os.ReadFile(filename)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Error reading file '%s': %s\n", filename, err.Error())
		return
	}

	// Do something with the file data
	fmt.Printf("File contents: %s\n", string(data))
}

```

In this example, the os.Stat function is called with the filename as its argument. If the file does not exist, os.IsNotExist returns true and an error is logged. If the file exists, the file data is read using os.ReadFile, and printed to the console.
